### Learn Webpage
* Every Web Page mainly consists of **HTML**, **CSS** and since this are so vast to learn the best way to make you perfect each day is by coding what every the idea pops too. _ex: i want to make a button or blue color and keep it in right side of my page... **JUST GOOGLE**_ **Draw on paper then code later**.
